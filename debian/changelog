ros-kinetic-smach (2.0.1-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * updated changelogs
  * Add timeout on termination child states.
    This is to handle cases where child states refuse to terminate. Providing a timeout value allows the concurrence to return that long after a termination event (preempt or child completion) has happened. If the argument is ommitted from the init method then the default behaviour (no timeout) is used.
  * Added check for immediate preemption to Concurrence.
    This is necessary because a prior state may have failed to honour a preempt and thus it could be passed to us.
  * 2.0.0
  * Updating changelogs
  * Merging changes, resolving conflicts, from strands-project (@cburbridge)
  * cleaning up and removing rosbuild support
  * merging groovy and hydro
  * Merge pull request #4 <https://github.com/strands-project/executive_smach/issues/4> from strands-project/groovy-devel

  * Merge pull request #26 <https://github.com/strands-project/executive_smach/issues/26> from orzechow/groovy-devel
    Fixed invalid exception type in concurrence.py
  * Fixed invalid exception type in concurrence.py
  * Checking threads have fully terminated before cleanup of outcomes dict
    This commit uses thread.isAlive() on each concurrent state runner to check for termination of all the threads before continuing. This is necessary as only checking that the outcome has been filled in does not mean the thread has completed; if the thread has not completed it may not yet have called the termination callback. If this loop exits before the termination callback of the last thread is called, then the callback will occasionally be sent an empty dictionary (when the main thread has got to line 305).
  * cope with missed state termination notifications
    Concurrent states could terminate and notify _ready_event without the concurrence container realising, as it could be busy checking the outcome values. This makes the concurrency container get stuck on line 250. This commit adds a timeout to the wait to safely cope with missing notifications.
  * Adding event for thread synchronization in concurrence and using event not condition in monitor state
